countries.

## Week of May 19th to May 25th: Brajan Gruda: Attacker, Brighton

#### Stats: 73 minutes, 1 assist, 5 chances created, 1 BCM, 2 Shots on target, 4 recoveries, 4/5 duels won

Brajan Gruda played an instrumental role in Brighton’s 3-2 win vs
premier league champions Liverpool on Monday, May 19th. The German was
involved in nearly everything positive about their attack and linkup
play. Gruda usually lines up as a right winger for the Seagulls but
today he was deployed in a much more central position that appeared to
suit him quite well. He has the technical elegance to turn and looks
right at home in the tight spaces between the lines. His dribbling
created space for teammates and drew in defenders that did not want any
part of trying to tackle him. The 20 year old came over from Mainz last
summer and has been on the fringes of the squad, often being used as a
substitute, but is maybe finding his groove here as the season winds
down. He is most certainly a player to watch out for next season.

Gruda’s stats are based on a sample size of only 611 minutes, so it’s
important to take them with a grain of salt. He’s accumulated these
stats over the course of 21 games this season, with a lot of those being
substitute appearances with limited minutes That being said, he
currently ranks quite well in assists per 90, tackles per 90, and shot
creating actions per 90, which is understandable watching him play.
Usually deployed off the right wing, Gruda is one of those players who
glides with with the ball, looking to come inside onto his favored left
foot. However, he often begins to come inside further back and attack
the half space to create for his team, rather than a more traditional
winger looking to cut in and shoot near the box. That being said, he is
not afraid to use his right foot and drive the defense back. I
personally love his skill set in the middle of the pitch as a 10. He’s
very comfortable on the turn and he’s great a manipulating passing lanes
and pulling the strings in attack, exactly what he did against
Liverpool. his assist was nothing short of brilliant, a quick-thinking
one touch pass over the top of the defense which was turned home by
Yasin Ayari.

He also showcased his ability in tight spaces, turning and attacking the
defense on his way to 5 chances created for his team, including this
wonderful layoff that really should’ve resulted in an assist.

As mentioned before, Gruda’s first season on the south coast of England
was a bit underwhelming as a whole, but at only 20 years old, he’s got
plenty of time to nail down a place in Brighton’s crowded team,
especially as they may lose some players in the summer. Make sure to
watch for Brajan Gruda next season as he may just be Brighton’s next
gem.

## \*Week of May 13th to May 18th: Marc Bernal: CDM Barcelona

#### Marc Bernal tore his ACL back in September, but without a real standout performer this week, I will highlight him before he comes back next season, as he impressed before his injury

The 2024/25 season was supposed to be Marc Bernal’s breakthrough year.
With Gavi and Frenkie De Jong out injured to start the year, Hansi Flick
trusted the 18 year old Bernal to start in midfield for Barcelona’s
first 3 league games. Had he himself not gotten injured at the end of
August, he most likely would’ve been a household name at this point. The
6’3” midfielder nonetheless put LaLiga on notice, providing a physical
element to Barcelona’s midfield of technicians, while also displaying
the technical prowess that we’ve come to expect from La Masia graduates.

Marc Bernal unfortunately only managed 272 minutes before his injury, so
it is not really worth looking at his stats. That being said, you can
really see his star quality when he’s on the pitch. Standing at 6’3”,
Bernal adds a physical presence to Barcelona’s midfield. He uses his
long legs to win duels against ball carriers, and is a great 1v1
defender at his young age. He can cover the width of the field and is
comfortable defending near the sideline, something that Barcelona need
with their high back-line and high pressure system. He’s also
comfortable defending deeper and dropping between the center backs if a
cross might come in or if the other team is sustaining pressure.

In possession, Bernal is very comfortable in the pocket just in front of
the defense. His skill-set and role are very similar to Arsenal’s Thomas
Partey. He’s comfortable receiving the ball on the turn and playing
incisive passes forward, or carrying the ball up the field. When
carrying the ball he’s got a great ability to use his long strides to
dangle the ball out in front of defenders, making them think they can
win it, before passing it off or touching it around them. When Barcelona
sustain possession higher up the pitch, he operates a little deeper,
often picking up the ball and switching the play with his passing range.

Barcelona definitely have another midfield gem in Marc Bernal. ACL
injuries are tough to come back from at any age, so I really hope he
comes the same player. Barcelona had an extremely successful season
dominating LaLiga, winning the Copa del Rey, and coming just a few
minutes away from making the UCL final, so breaking into that team would
be difficult for any player. That being said, manager Hansi Flick has
already proven that he trusts Marc Bernal, so keep an eye for him when
he returns from injury next year
